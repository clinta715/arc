This is a small archive handling program, written as an exercise in understanding tcl/tk
What I learned about tcl/tk is that I don't want to use it for future projects, and that PyQt6 is amazing

The program was more or less designed with Claude who implemented the individual archive handler functions which, tbh, i'm not sure that's how I would do it if I redid the application.
At some point, I may attempt to redo the tool with command line tools and variable-substitution sort of like the Syncz app, and a more or less generic archive handling/viewing/etc function.

Going through some iterations here but I think the next stage is to move it to PyQt6 if it's going to be a serious application.
